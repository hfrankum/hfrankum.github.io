	<H2> <i> About Me! </i> </H2>
	<p> Hi, my name is Haley Frankum I am 19 years young. My birthday is July 20th, 1999. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and moved on Lake Lanier in Gainesville, Georgia when I was three. The lake I live on is truly one of my favorite things. I have grown up learning about boats and all types of water activities. Growing up on the lake, one of my favorite things is to come home and bring friends home from college. It is so fun to be able to show your new friends your home and introduce them to your family as well.  </p>
	<H2> <i> About My Family </i> </H2>
	<p> Both of my parents, Greg and Sherri Frankum, are originally from Gainesville and have called this place home since they were born. I have a brother named Will who is twenty five and a sister named Brinkley who is twenty three. All of us are extremely close and enjoy time spent together. We have dog named Dash who we all adore and love coming home to. Dash is our first and only dog which is why we love him so much! He is always the best house greeter. Visit this link to see a photo of Dash!

	<H2> <i> About My Education </H2> </i>
	<p> Currently, I am a student at <A href="https://www.uga.edu"> The University of Georgia </A>. I am a Business major, but not sure what I would like to do after college yet. Some of my favorite classes at UGA include Computer Science, Communication, and Geography. I have enjoyed most of my classes at school and cannot wait to get into my major classes to find what interests me. I am very anxious to know what I will do after college, but working hard to get there in the meantime. I am hoping to find a marketing job after college preferably in Atlanta to begin with, but I am sure that could change in the next few years. </p>
